This document describes the New Mexico Water Data Initiative’s (WDI) preferred way to receive data related to measurements of the depth to water in groundwater wells. There are several fields that will be required as a minimum for sharing this data. Other fields are desired to better understand the data, but are not required. A data dictionary including a glossary of these required and desired fields is included at the end of this document. 

Following the best practices described here will allow water level measurement data to be more easily ingested into the WDI platforms and tools. It will also increase consistency across the Water Data Catalog. In addition to this document, we have provided template files that can be used as examples. 


## File Structure and Format
### File Format
Water level  measurements should be provided in two separate files, one with location and well 
construction data, and one with water level measurements. **The site_id field should be provided in both files to allow them to be joined.** This reduces the amount of repeated information if there are many measurements for each well. It is preferred that all measurement data be provided in one measurement file even if there are multiple wells.

### File Type
Files should be provided as .csv tables with one sheet or table per file. Excel spreadsheets with multiple worksheets or tabs are not ideal, they are not readable by the Data Catalog’s data API.

### File Names
The most important things to remember about file naming are to be consistent
and descriptive in naming your files so that it’s obvious what it contains. The preferred format for file names is as follows:

```
Agency_Region_Project Name_YYYYMM_DataType _Version 
```

the date could be a date range if data are collected over multiple years as in the example below.

```
NMBGMR_Statewide_HealyNetwork_WL_200010_202401_v1
```

### Updating Existing Files
When new data have been collected, it should be added to the existing .csv table with previous data and uploaded as the same resource on the data catalog.

## Data Structure and Format
### Field Names
Recommended field names for both the location and measurement files are provided in the data 
dictionary tables below.  
- Field names (column headers) should be descriptive. 
- Field names should not include special characters except underscores `_`.  
- Avoid using spaces. Use underscores where a space is needed. 
- Do not begin field names with a number. 
- All field names should be in the first row. 
- Use all lowercase letters in field names.

### Formatting of Cells and Measurement Values
- List one value per cell. Do not put multiple observations, codes, types of data (e.g. date and time), coordinates, 
  etc. in one cell, dates (`YYYYMMDD`) do not need to be split out. 
- Do not merge cells. 
- Measurement values should be reported as depth to water  in feet below ground surface. 
- If continuous and manual measurements are included in the same table they should be in the same field and differentiated with a measurement_type field; time (`HH:MM AM/PM`); date (`YYYYMMDD`). 
- Do not include units in the same cells as values.

### Required and Desired Fields
The data dictionary tables below provide the minimum required fields and additional 
fields that increase the usefulness of the data. Required fields are necessary  for the data to be usable by WDI. 
Desired fields greatly increase the value and usability of the data provided. Data providers are welcome to provide 
additional fields to what are recommended here and should include metadata descriptions of any additional fields. 

### Geographic Information 
Coordinate information for groundwater well locations is essential to understand water level data. Locations without x,y data (coordinates) should not be included. The preferred coordinate system is latitude and longitude in decimal degrees and geodetic datum of WGS 84. However, other coordinate systems, (e.g. UTM, state plane) and datums (e.g. NAVD 83, NAD 27) are accepted. Please specify the coordinate system and horizontal datum used in the .csv tables as indicated in the data dictionary below. Indicating the vertical datum (e.g. NAVD 88), is also useful information, but is not always available depending on how information about elevation is derived, and is therefore not required.  More information about geodetic datums can be found here: https://vdatum.noaa.gov/docs/datums.html.

### Units
Wherever a measurement value is provided, an additional field should be included specifying measurement 
units as shown in the data dictionaries below and in the example templates.

### Location File Data Dictionary
See the attached location file template as an example.
