# New Mexico Water Data Catalog User Guide

## Introduction
The New Mexico Water Data Catalog [catalog.newmexicowaterdata.org](https://catalog.newmexicowaterdata.org) is 
developed in a free, open-source, 
data platform called Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN).

This user guide has been developed  for members of organizations that contribute to the New Mexico Water Data Catalog.  
You do not need to be a member of an organization, or have a login or password to search the data catalog, and download data.

**In order to add new data  to the Data Catalog, you must be a member of an organization and  have login credentials.
The Water Data Team at  the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources can make a page for your organization,
and assign you login credentials. Please contact us:**

This user guide covers using CKANâ€™s web interface to organize, publish and find data. 
CKAN also has a powerful API (machine interface), which makes it easy to develop extensions and links 
with other information systems. The API is documented in [API guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/index.html).
